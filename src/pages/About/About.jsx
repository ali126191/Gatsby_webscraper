        <p>Vithoba is considered a manifestation of Lord Vishnu or his avatar Krishna and is often represented as a dark young adolescent with arms akimbo and standing on a brick. Vithoba is often accompanied by his main consort Rakhumai. Vithoba legend revolves around his role as a savior to the poet saints of the Varkari faith who are known for abhanga, a unique genre of devotional lyric composed in Marathi. The most important festivals of Shri Vithoba are held on the 11th day of the Hindu lunar months: Shayani Ekadashi in the month of Ashadha, and Prabodhini Ekadashi in the month of Kartik.</p>
